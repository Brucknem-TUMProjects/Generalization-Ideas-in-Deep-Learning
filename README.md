# Generalization Ideas in Deep-Learning

This repository holds the code and report for the [Seminar: Optimization and Generalization in Deep Learning](https://vision.in.tum.de/teaching/ws2019/dltheory_ws19) held by [Thomas Frerix](https://vision.in.tum.de/members/frerix) from the [Chair of Computer Vision & Artificial Intelligence](https://vision.in.tum.de/) at [Technische Universität München](https://www.tum.de/).

# Overview
I will explore different measures for the generalization ability of neural nets.
