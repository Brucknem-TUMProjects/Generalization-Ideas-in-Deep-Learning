\section{Conclusion}
We saw that the norm-based capacity controls provide a good direction into understanding the empirical phenomena that correlate with the generalization ability of deep neural networks, but also that they alone are not sufficient to explain every phenomenon and further research is necessary. For sharpness, we have seen that it does not provide a valid capacity measure on its own and that it is not sufficient to ensure generalization. \ns{} provide some further investigation of expected sharpness in the PAC-Bayesian framework and how they can be combined to provide a capacity measure.
